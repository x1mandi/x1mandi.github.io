I am from Budapest, Hungary and this is my technical blog.

I am planning to collect my adventures with the Perl programming language, and collect my artifacts (anything useful found or invented during work, life, practicing, etc).

You, dear visitor might have a couple of questions:
 
Why are You learning Perl in 2020?
Perl is still used in many companies around the world. I started to learn Linux way back in 2006, and still using several distributions since then, mainly I like Debian-based OSes (MX Linux, Ubuntu), but using RHEL and Oracle at work. I beleive Perl can teach you a lot of things about Linux and computers in general extend your knowledge about these topics, and also give you more power. So it is important to spread the world about the greatness and currentness of the Perl Programming language even if You are a beginner. That's one reason.
On the other hand, Perl's creator Larry Wall was graduating with BA in Natural and Artificial Languages. I have a master's degree in Russian Linguistics and Literature, and it caught my attention, that someone learning Humanities could create such a programming language. I was interested in the logic behind Perl, which has in fact several solutions borrowed from natural languages, see the TMTOWTDI, special variables (`$_`,` @_`), references, and so on.

How to pronounce Your name?
My name is Csaba, this is a traditinal Hungarian name. It is pronounced like this: _/tʃɒbɒ/_. Actually the _"cs"_ is a letter in Hungarian, and it is the most difficult to pronounce, it sounds like the first sound in the words _check_, _cheek_ or _Charlie_.
Please check [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_alphabet) for more information about pronounciation about sounds (if You are interested).

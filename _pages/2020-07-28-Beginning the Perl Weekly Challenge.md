title: "Beginning the Perl Weekly Challenge"

Last week I started to contribute to the Perl Weekly Challenge by Mohammad Anwar.
It was the 70th week of challenges, but I followed PWC since the beginning.
It is a good place to begin practicing and coding.
The tasks might be difficult for a beginner, but with hard but doable challenges we can learn.

The task was abput character swapping, where we had an input string, a swap count and an offset.

As shown in the example the first character in the string should be ignored, although I could not get it why.
Actually the script worked without that constraint.

Another criteria I did not get, was that $C <= $O, because $S = 'abcd', $C = 2, $O = 1. For me this use case worked as well.

Will need to ask the PWC team about these questions.
